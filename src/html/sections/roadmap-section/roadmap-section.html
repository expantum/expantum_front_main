            <p class="base-text">
                We’re thrilled to present our first iteration of Expantum’s roadmap. Expantum is a riveting military strategy game with a
                unique tokenomics model that empowers players and rewards them for their time, skill, and contribution to the in-game
                economy. Like all crypto projects, changes occur with timelines and features. Our roadmap is subject to change and is a
                living document. Changes will be transparent, as they will be published for our community in real time.

                            We are big into DeFi. We will launch our staking dApp to our token holders to earn high APY. In return, our
                            project receives liquidity to supercharge our growth. Our vault allows for DeFi to be integrated into our
                            project. It’s a win-win.
